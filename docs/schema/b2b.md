This guide explains how B2B SaaS companies should send core user and account lifecycle data to Intilery.

## Overview

Most B2B SaaS companies have a few common, core lifecycle events for users and accounts. We understand that account hierarchies can be unique and complex, but by following this spec you can take advantage of account-based tools on the Intilery platform.

## Events

The B2B SaaS category has the following semantic events:

### Account Created

This event should be sent when a new account is created.

#### Properties

This event supports the following semantic properties:

| PROPERTY          | TYPE   | DESCRIPTION                            |
| ----------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `account_name`    | String | The name of the account being created. |
| `context.groupId` | String | The id of the account being created.   |

#### Example

```json
{
  "userId": "019mr8mf4r",
  "type": "track",
  "event": "Account Created",
  "properties": {
    "account_name": "Initech"
  },
  "context": {
      "groupId": "acct_123"
      }
}
```

### Account Deleted

This event should be sent when an account is deleted.

#### Properties

This event supports the following semantic properties:

| PROPERTY          | TYPE   | DESCRIPTION                            |
| ----------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `account_name`    | String | The name of the account being deleted. |

    "account_name": "Initech"
  },
  "context": {
      "groupId": "acct_123"
      }
}
```

### Signed Up

This event should be sent when a user signs up for your service.

**Good to know**: Intilery’s best practice is to use an “Object-Action” naming convention, which in this case would be “User Signed Up”. However, because in the B2B case this may not be a specific user, we omit that noun in our example. You may include or omit it as needed for your implementation.

#### Properties

This event supports the following semantic properties:

| PROPERTY          | TYPE   | DESCRIPTION                                |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `type`            | String | The type of signup, e.g. invited, organic. |
| `first_name`      | String | The first name of the user.                |
| `last_name`       | String | The last name of the user.                 |
| `email`           | String | The email of the user.                     |
| `phone`           | String | The phone number of the user.              |
| `username`        | String | The username of the user.                  |
| `title`           | String | The title of the user.                     |
| `context.groupId` | String | The id of the account the user is joining. |

#### Example

```json
{
  "userId": "019mr8mf4r",
  "type": "track",
  "event": "Signed Up",
  "properties": {

    "title": "Mr"
  },
  "context": {
      "groupId": "acct_123"
      }
}
```

### Signed In

This event should be sent when a user signs in to your service.

**Good to know**: Intilery best practice is to use an “Object-Action” naming convention, which in this case would be “User Signed In”. However, because in the B2B case this may not be a specific user, we omit that noun in our example. You may include or omit it as needed for your implementation.

#### Properties

This event supports the following semantic properties:

| PROPERTY          | TYPE   | DESCRIPTION                          |

  "properties": {
    "username": "pgibbons"
  },
  "context": {
      "groupId": "acct_123"
      }
}
```

### Signed Out

This event should be sent when a user signs out for your service. You should also call `analytics.reset()` to refresh the cookie when a Signed Out event occurs.

**Good to know**: Intilery's best practice is to use an “Object-Action” naming convention, which in this case would be “User Signed Out”. However, because in the B2B case this may not be a specific user, we omit that noun in our example. You may include or omit it as needed for your implementation.

#### Properties

This event supports the following semantic properties:

| PROPERTY          | TYPE   | DESCRIPTION                          |
