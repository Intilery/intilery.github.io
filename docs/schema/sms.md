SMS sent using the Intilery platform will automatically capture all events described here, if you wish to use a different SMS Provider, you should ensure that the provider can send the required events to the Intilery CDP.

The semantic events detailed below represent the ideal for SMS events and what Intilery provides by default; not every SMS tool supports all of these events or all of their properties.

## Overview

SMS is sent to a customer and will be attempted to be delivered by a network. 
Usually you can expect an SMS to arrive with the customer in a few seconds,
however, due to connectivity issues, it is possible that the SMS can take up to 3 days
to arrive before the network will cease trying to send.

We raise an [SMS Sent](#sms-sent) event on sending the SMS to the networks to 
deliver the message, and based on their feedback of delivery we will raise an
[SMS Delivered](#sms-delivered) event.


## Events

The email category has the following semantic events:

- [SMS Sent](#sms-sent)
- SMS Recipient Invalid
- [SMS Not Sent](#sms-not-sent)
- [SMS Delivered](#sms-delivered)

**Note:** All events below are automatically sent to the Intilery CDP by the Intilery
Customer Engagement platform if Intilery sends the SMS

### SMS Not Sent
