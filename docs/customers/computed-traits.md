Computed Traits allow you to quickly create customer-level calculations that Intilery keeps up-to-date over time. These can be computations like the `total_num_orders` a customer has completed, the `lifetime_revenue` of a customer, the `most_frequent_category` to determine which category the customer most frequently pruchases. These computations are based on your events and event properties that you are sending through Intilery on the [page](/docs/schema/page) and [track](/docs/schema/track) calls.

## Processing

Computed traits are updated every 30 minutes. Therefore if you are using the value of a computed trait in a journey, in a split for example, add a wait step of 30 minutes proceeding the use of the computed trait to ensure the value is up to date

***Note:*** It is not currently possible to trigger a journey from the change of a value of a computed trait

## Types of Computed Traits

Customers currently supports the following types of computed traits:

- Types of Computed Traits
  - [Event Counter](#event-counter)
  - [Aggregation](#aggregation)
  - [Most Frequent](#most-frequent)
  - [First](#first)
  - [Last](#last)
  - [Unique List](#unique-list)
  - [Unique List Count](#unique-list-count)
- [Conditions](#conditions)
- [Accessing your Computed Traits using the Profiles API](#accessing-your-computed-traits-using-the-profiles-api)

### Event Counter

An Event Counter trait stores a count of an **event** over a period of time. For example, you can create a trait called `number_logins_90_days` based on a `User Logged In` event. You can also use event properties to only specific types of events.

Customer-level examples:

- Orders Completed Last 30 Days
- Pricing Page Views Last 30 Days

### Aggregation

An aggregation computes a **sum, average, minimum, or maximum** of a numeric **event property**. A good example is a `sum_games_revenue_90_days` if you’re sending an `Order Completed` event with a `revenue` property. In the example we’re refining the revenue even further based on another event property: `category = 'games'`. Note that you can only compute an aggregation trait for event properties that have a numeric value.

Customer-level examples:

- Order Revenue Last 14 Days
- Max Ride Distance Last 60 Days

### Most Frequent

A most frequent customer-level computed trait will return the **most common value** for an **event property**. This is helpful to create traits like `preferred_product_viewed` or `most_commonly_viewed_category` that tell you what a customer's preferred product, or content category might be. Note that the most frequent computed trait requires the event property to have been tracked at least twice. In the case of a tie, we return the first alphabetical value.

Customer-level examples:

- Favorite Blog Post
- Top Purchase Category

### First

The first customer-level trait returns the first event property value we have seen. This is common for creating traits like `first_page_visited` based on the page name.

Customer-level examples:

- First seen timestamp
- First utm parameter

![First](/img/first.png)

### Last

The last trait returns the last event property value we have seen. This is common for creating traits like `last_utm_campaign` to help you calculate last-touch attribution for paid advertising.

Customer-level examples:

- Last seen at
- Last utm parameter

![Last](/img/last.png)

### Unique List

Unique list computed traits will output a **list of unique values** for an **event property**. This is helpful to understand the different types of products or content that a customer has interacted with or purchased. You can create a triat like `unique_product_categories_viewed` and send marketing communications based on the categories viewed.

Example use cases:

- Unique products purchased
- Unique categories
- Unique games played

### Unique List Count

Unique list count computed traits will output a **count of the unique list of values** for an **event property**. You can create a traits like `unique_product_categories_viewed_count` to understand the variety of products that a customer is viewing.

Customer-level examples:

- Unique products viewed count
- Unique categories count

## Conditions

All computed trait types support a common “Add Conditions” section. Conditions defined here restrict the messages considered when calculating the final value of the computed trait by looking at a property of the events. For example, you could limits events to only those where “price” is greater than 30.00 or where “page.url” contains “pricing”.

The following operators are available.

- equals
- not equals -
- less than
- greater than
- less than or equal
- greater than or equal
- contains
- does not contain
- starts with
- ends with
- exists
- not exists
- before date
- after date
- within last (x days)
- with next (x days)
- before last (x days)
- after next (x days)

## Accessing your Computed Traits using the Profiles API

You can access your computed traits using the Profile API by querying the `/traits` endpoint. All types of traits are returned for the customer

```
https://tracking.intilery.com/track/intilery/marketing/MARKETING/v1/profiles/email:xxx.xxx@intilery.com/traits
```

returns:

```
