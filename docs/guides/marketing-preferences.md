# Marketing Preferences

Intilery host a basic marketing preferences page which can be linked to in all of your 
email communications.  This can be used by the customer to subscribe or opt out 
of communications based on communication medium (channel) or subscription 
category (interests).

When in the email editor, you can insert this link by choosing **Special links** > 
**Subscription** > **Manage Subscription Preferences**.

If a custom version of this page is required, it can be self-hosted.
