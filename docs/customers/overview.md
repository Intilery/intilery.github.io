Intilery is a powerful Customer Data Platform that enables you to create unified customer profiles in Intilery, to build and enrich audiences and send marketing campaigns to those customers and audiences, along with personalisation.

### What can you do with Customers?

#### Build Audiences

Create a list of customers match specific criteria, for example “inactive accounts” (paying accounts who haven’t logged in in 60 days), and use that Audience for automagted marketing activites. Learn more about [audiences](/docs/customers/audiences).

## Customers core components

Before you start setting up Customers, here are some features and terms that we’ll use in this documentation. The main parts of Customers are your schema, audiences, schemas and the single customer view.

## Audiences

An [Audience](/docs/customers/audiences/) is a list of customers who match a specific criteria. An example of a basic Audience that our marketing team might build is an “active sign ups” audience for an email marketing campaign. This Audience is contains all customers who signed up in the last seven days on the free plan. The example below shows how you could define this audience in the Audience Builder.

## Single Customer View

The Intilery single customer view is the single view of your customer in Intilery. *Traits* are customer attributes that you can see in the activity viewer.

- This contains all of the data that you have on a customer - from their event history to their traits and all your interactions
