This schema is based on the Segment V2 ecommerce spec it has been extended to work in a multinational audience, particularly currencies, which are not supported in the Segment spec

**Note:** The convention in the UK is to call the cart a "basket", keeping to the Segment spec "basket" is called a "cart"

Intilery’s e-commerce Schema helps define the journey for a customer as they browse your store, click on promotions, view products, add those products to a cart, and complete a purchase.
